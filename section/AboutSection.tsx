            I bring 13+ years of digital marketing expertise to web design,
            creating websites that are not only visually appealing but also
            built to drive results. Having worked with multi-million-dollar
            brands, I know what compels online audiences to act.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™ve managed high-impact campaigns, analyzed vast amounts of data,
            and developed a strategic, revenue-driven approach to web design.
            Unlike large agencies, I take a personalized, hands-on approach,
            working with only three new clients per month to ensure every
            project gets the attention it deserves.
